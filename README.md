Givin' GitHub a try

Hello GitHubers,

Interpreting analytical data and creating an actionable work plan to successfully bring a product to market or to help continue its current growth brings me almost as much joy cuddling my cat after a long dayâ€™s work. With over five years of product and marketing management experience across a diverse range of fields, I look forward to taking on and spearheading my next long term possibility.
